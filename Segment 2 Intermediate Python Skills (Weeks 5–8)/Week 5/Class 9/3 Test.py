# Question: Test NumPy - Matrix Multiplication
# Objective:
# Write a program in Python using NumPy to perform matrix multiplication. Follow these steps:

# Input:

# 1 Take input for two matrices from the user.
# 2 Each matrix should have 4 elements, and the program should ask for the number of rows and columns for both matrices.


# Task 1:
# 1 Create a function to check if the two matrices can be multiplied.
# 2 Hint: Matrix A can be multiplied by Matrix B if the number of columns in Matrix A equals the number of rows in Matrix B.



# Task 2:
# If the matrices are multipliable, write a function to perform the multiplication and return the resulting matrix.
# If not, return "Not Multipliable".
# Output:

# Print the resulting matrix or the "Not Multipliable" message.
